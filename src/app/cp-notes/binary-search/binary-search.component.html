      <p>When finding local minima / maxima in a discrete range like an array, it's actually more effective and simpler to do a binary search than a ternary search</p>

      <p>When finding minima / maxima in a continuous range, one can minimise calls to f(x) by reusing one of the middle values calculated in the previous iteration, it's most optimal to do this based on little Î¦</p>
